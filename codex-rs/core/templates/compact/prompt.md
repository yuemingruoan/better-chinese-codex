You are performing a CONTEXT CHECKPOINT COMPACTION. Create a handoff summary for another LLM that will resume the task.

Include:
- Current progress and key decisions made
- Important context, constraints, or user preferences
- What remains to be done (clear next steps)
- Any critical data, examples, or references needed to continue
- If a task checklist or task.md appears in context, include its current completion status and remaining items

Be concise, structured, and focused on helping the next LLM seamlessly continue the work.
